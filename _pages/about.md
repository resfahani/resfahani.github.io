Hi! I’m a postdoctoral researcher at ISTerre in Grenoble, France. My research is in the intersect of computational and observational seismology, where I explore how data-driven methods can help us better understand the Earth’s dynamic behavior. I’m especially interested in using large-scale seismic datasets to detect subtle signals, image subsurface structures, and monitor how things change over time—like the early stages of earthquakes or volcanic activity.

I enjoy developing tools that combine physics with machine learning, and I’m passionate about making seismic data more accessible, interpretable, and useful for both science and society.


**Research interests:**

- Machine Learning in Seismology  
- Computational Data Seismology  
- Near-surface Seismology
