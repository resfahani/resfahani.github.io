Hi! I’m a postdoctoral researcher at ISTerre in Grenoble, France. My research lies at the intersection of computational and observational seismology. I explore how artificial intelligence can be used to analyze seismic data and enhance our understanding of the Earth’s dynamic behavior. I’m particularly interested in leveraging large-scale seismic datasets to detect subtle signals, image subsurface structures, and monitor velocity changes.

**Research interests:**

- Machine Learning in Seismology  
- Computational Data Seismology  
- Near-surface Seismology
